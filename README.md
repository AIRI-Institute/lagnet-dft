# LAGNet: better electron density prediction

This is the official implementation of LAGNet, a neural network for electron density prediction. The model is specifically optimized for drug-like small molecules and data from LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) solvers.

Additionally, this repository includes independent implementations of the invariant and equivariant DeepDFT models.

# Work in progress

We are currently migrating the code from a private repository to this public one. This process may take some time.

If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue. We are happy to help!
